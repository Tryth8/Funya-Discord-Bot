4 years ago my girlfriend decided to get a dog in the future, and after much thought, we came up with a name. 

Now we donâ€™t have the opportunity to have a dog, so I decided that I could create Funya in this form. So it has a couple of weird features like barking or joining voice chat. He literally doesn't say anything, but my girlfriend and I love to invite him over when we're doing something on Discord. 

He does not have many abilities yet, but I will definitely add many more features to him in the future.
